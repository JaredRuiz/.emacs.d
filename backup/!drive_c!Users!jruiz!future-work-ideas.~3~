- Ask Steve: want to be lead dev on a project, working underneath an architect, and two junior developers underneath me. Would like to be involved from beginning with infrastructure/architecture decisions, and laying out prototype code.

- Side project: getting containerization (docker, etc.) set up for Wegmans and other projects
  * launch cosmos
  * launch different APIs as separate services/containers
  * launch front-end
  * should also handle downloading and managing all npm packages, etc.

- Get emacs dev environment better set up locally for Windows stuff; put it on Github!!  

 - While waiting for more stories: do better testing!!

 - Need to talk with Steve about better mentoring for me, and me getting to work with others.

  - getting scripts set up in git bash!!
