3 most important accomplishments on the job in the last year?
   - learning C#, .NET, etc.
   - helping John through issues, explaining architecture to him, 
   - learning more about Angular/Angular.js in general, did not have a good experience with this in the past
   - experience in CSS plus bootstrap and flexbox, had never done any of these before
   - was proud of work done writing Revit plug-ins (even though took a while); thought code was good and well-tested, and seems to work well after getting feedback from clients, was largely done independently and a big learning process
   - being a servant and vital team member to clients (especially at UPMCE since working on site); dealt with difficult team members and think I conducted myseld professionally and correctly represented CEI
   - learned docker and containerization; wrote basic scripts to help automate start-up/teardown

  3 best strengths;
   - ability to lean new technologies and industries quickly; continue to take on new tasks, continue learning/studying
   - ability to quickly assimilate into a team and understand team dynamics; continue to work in different environments with different team members of varying experience and personalities
   - ability to understand client business problems or other issues raised by clients or internally and come up with solutions; more or less same as above - listen, understand client industry in general and try to see things from their perspective, leave ego out of things
