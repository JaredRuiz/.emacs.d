notes for tomorrow:
   - can probably make a new class/method for the different parameter values/types
    - let Jason know we can also set element properties (SetParam or something)...is this what we want to do??
    - how to search for all or new elements in Revit and bring only those guys in? Probably need to do a filter
    - do quick research on UI stuff...what is needed, etc?


  Voting n that:
 Supposedley the Russians hacked some voting booths and may have influcenced the 2016 presidential election. In fact Reality Winner, the woman from the NSA who supposedley leaked this information to the Intercept back in ____, just pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 5 years in prison.

  But what is more alarming is this news article about how easy it is to hack into this stuff: _____. Also related is how easy it is to hack into satellites and make them do the person's bidding: ____. I want to break down these stories and give a clearer picture of what they describe. Then talk about how we can make technologies like this even more secure. Finally maybe I'll even use my soapbox to talk about how flawed our voting system is (with or without voting booths and software) and encourage folks to start thinking about preferential voting! Woohoo! Let's do it!
