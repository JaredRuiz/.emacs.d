notes for tomorrow:
   - can probably make a new class/method for the different parameter values/types
    - let Jason know we can also set element properties (SetParam or something)...is this what we want to do??
    - how to search for all or new elements in Revit and bring only those guys in? Probably need to do a filter
    - do quick research on UI stuff...what is needed, etc?


  Voting n that:
 Supposedley the Russians hacked some voting booths and may have influcenced the 2016 presidential election. In fact Reality Winner, the woman from the NSA who supposedley leaked this information to the Intercept back in ____, just pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 5 years in prison.

  But what is more alarming is this news article about how easy it is to hack into this stuff: _____. Also related is how easy it is to hack into satellites and make them do the person's bidding: ____. I want to break down these stories and give a clearer picture of what they describe. Then talk about how we can make technologies like this even more secure. Finally maybe I'll even use my soapbox to talk about how flawed our voting system is (with or without voting booths and software) and encourage folks to start thinking about preferential voting! Woohoo! Let's do it!

  So first off, how does one "hack" into a satellite or voting booth (maybe drop the satellite stuff for now). There are usually two ways: 1) steal or guess a user's username and password and gain access that way, or 2) exploit a security flaw in the software that just allows access. #2 is a bit easier to understand, there are all sorts of examples of this (SITE). All those big stories you sometimes see usually involve security issues. One of the craziest I saw was someone hitting the delete button 14 times on a Linux machine which then gave them sudo access. Htf did they figure that out? I just image a room full of monkeys banging on keyboards until they get into the system or Hamlet is written.

  Let's talk about #1. This is some spy stuff here, and it happens all the time. Sarah Palin had her Yahoo! account hacked years ago because someone reset her password - they gained access to her email, tried to login, and hit the "I forgot my password" button. They then asked her security questions...the answers to which the hacker was able to guess just from listening to her speeches (for example: "where did you meet your husband?" "In college").

  Another common way hackers gain access are by "phishing attacks." You've probably seen this term come up before. This involves spam email. Everyone at a company, like one of the ones who make voting booth software, all gets a spam email saying they need to reset their Gmail passwords. But its not from Gmail, its from a hacker. This usually doesn't work 

  Remember:
 1) why its important to peeps in Rust Belt: our region is one of the most highly contested (SITE) in elections, so if votes are going to be switched, it could happen here. If Alabama goes for the Democrat candidate next election nobody is going to believe the voting booths *weren't* switched.
  
  2) what can be done: good question. Probably making the booths more secure in the first place. This involves better crypto on the machines themselves (jobs), and better workers monitoring booths (more jobs). Also it means better (if any) security audits on the companies that make the voting machines in the first place.  Blockchain technology can also be used...I don't want to get into this right now but suffice it to say that the same underlying tech used for Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies can also be used to ensure fair voting systems. Also online voting. More on that in a sec...SITE?

  3) Jobs: while I appreciate the old ladies volunteering their time at my local school on election day, we probably need more tech-saavy folks working at the voting booths. We should probably make voting more of a priority as well. And while tech can be used to make the machines safer, some shady stuff can go down at voting booths with a bunch of people in line and all the mayhem (SITE/PIC). Employing more people to come out and vote woul really be great. Alternatively, if there was more voting online then the federal overnment could contract different companies in each state to design secure websites and apps to allow people to vote from anywhere. We all bank online, why can't we vote online? TALK ABOUT THE SECURITY OF THAT!!! I don't like the federal govt being in charge of too much (or really anything besides education standards and regulations), and similarly I don't think a one-size-fits-all model would be a good idea for an online voting system. For one it's a honeypot for hackers - instead of hacking one system now you have to hack 50. Also, different states have different kinds of elections, hold them at different times, etc. More power to the states! For instance, in Iowa they do caucuses, but in Michigan they do primaries. Sticky. Plus it allows the feds to shell out money for others to work...more jobs!
