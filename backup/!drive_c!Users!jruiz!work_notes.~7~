notes for tomorrow:
    - let Jason know we can also set element properties (SetParam or something)...is this what we want to do??
    - do quick research on UI stuff...what is needed, etc?

  Part 1: Why we should care about Russian hacking in the Rust Belt
 Supposedley the Russians hacked into some voting booths and may have influcenced the 2016 presidential election. In fact Reality Winner, the woman from the NSA who supposedley leaked this information to the Intercept back in SITE, just pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 5 years in prison*.

I know what you're thinking: "OMG if I have to hear the word 'Russian' one more time I am going to drop-kick my computer." But this is not speculative smear journalism nor is it political...it's real and could happen right here in the Rust Belt! It's true. Pay attention, and I promise I will not use the "R" word one more time in this entire post. Control-F that shit if you don't believe me!

Apparently it's really easy to hack into voting booths: SITE. Probably even more alarming is that it's really easy to hack into satellites as well (SITE). You think you're getting directions to go to TGIF...but really you end up at Red Lobster. Oh those sneaky satellite hackers!

I know basically nothing about satellites so let's stick with voting. The Rust Belt is one of the most highly contested regions (SITE) in presidential elections. Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Michigan are huge swing states and the red vs blue line is as thin as ever, which means the Rust Belt could be a target for vote-hackers in the future. Let's be honest, nobody's gonna try to hack a booth in Alabama and convince everyone that they're now full of liberals.

So let's break down this voting-booth hacking story and give a clearer picture of what they describe. Then we'll talk about how we can use technology to have more secure voting systems. Finally I'll even use my soapbox to talk about how flawed our voting system is (with or without voting booths and software). It's time to take the power back!

* this is slightly off topic, but here is a really interesting post (which is a little dated) talking about Reality Winner and the irony of her whistleblowing.

Part 2: Htf does somebody hack into a voting booth (or anything for that matter)?
  So how does someone "hack" into a voting booth? A better question, how does someone hack into any computer or software system? There are generally two ways: 1) steal or guess a user's username and password which grants access to the importer, or 2) exploit a security flaw in the software that just allows access. #2 is a bit easier to understand, there are all sorts of examples of this (SITE). All those big stories you see usually involve security issues. One of the craziest I saw was someone hitting the delete button 14 times on a Linux machine which then gave them sudo access SITE. How the hell did they figure that out? I just imagine a room full of monkeys banging on keyboards until they get into the system...or Hamlet is written SITE. (Potential business idea: create computer security company which hires people to press buttons on computers all day in the hopes they will discover security flaws)

  Let's talk about #1: getting a user's credentials and just accessing the system as if you were them. This sounds like something from Misison Impossible, yet it happens all the time. This usually involves some kind of social engineering - someone being tricked into giving up their credentials. Like getting a call from a bank claiming there is an issue with your account and they need your name/SSN/address/account numbers. Don't give them that info! If it's the bank then call them back.

Or someone can simply guess your password, or even pretend to be you to gain access. Sarah Palin had her Yahoo! account SITE hacked years ago because someone reset her password. You read that right. They got her email address, tried to login, hit the "I forgot my password" button, and then successfully answered her security questions...the answers to which they guessed just from listening to her speeches. For example: "where did you meet your husband?" "In college." Yeah right...they met on Alaskan's Only (SITE: find Alaskan dating website)

  Another common way hackers gain access are by "phishing attacks." You've probably seen this term come up before...and possibly been confused by it like I usually am, cause the name doesn't make much sense. A phishing attack usually involves spam email, like one that says "send me your password" or "You need to click THIS LINK to update your password." Everyone at a company, like one of the ones who make voting booth software, all get a spam email saying they need to reset their Gmail passwords. But its not from Gmail, its from a hacker. Sometimes these are easy to spot, and you've probably received emails from people like "ALLCAPSNAME@zimbabe.com". Yet these can oftentimes be much more sophisticated. Now you know why your company makes you take those corporate compliant tests which teach you NOT to respond to emails which sound a bit shady.

  The really sophisticated ones involve using multiple types of social engineering and trying to get up to a big prize. Suppose everyone at a voting software company received an email like what's described above. While it's a long shot, all they would need is a single person to fall into their trap and give up their credentials. And then...the hackers do nothing. The person continues logging in with their new password, and doesn't even realize they
  ve been hacked. But then months later they could send *another* coworker an email from the now-hacked email, asking them to open a program in Microsoft Word...but actually this releases opens a program that infects the new user's computer with a virus and maybe gets deeper into their security. Then come voting day they have access to the company's system and can hopefully change votes. This sounds far-fetched but in fact SITE: this is exactly what happened in 2016 during the presidential election.

One of the problems is there should be way more failsafes in place than just usernames or passwords. So take a lesson from Sarah Palin...come up with harder (or fake) answers to security questions, and strong passwords. Use LastPass or something similar. It's been said multiple times, but seriously, DON'T OPEN LINKS sent in email unless you know or trust who the message is from. Also, while we're on the topic, don't think that fingerprints or facial recognition is any more secure...a digital photo or ink on some tape is good enough to get past these systems. What ever happened to two-factor authentication?!? Let's look at some ways to make these voting systems more secure.

  Part 3: Making voting booths unhackable.
So what can be done? First off let's take the social-engineering aspect from before and apply them to the people actually working at voting stations on election day. While I appreciate the old ladies volunteering their time at my local school on election day, the two of them alone are not enough. We probably need more alert volunteers, and some tech-saavy folks working at the voting booths. Some shady stuff can go down at voting booths with a bunch of people in line and all the mayhem (SITE/PIC).

There are only (SITE) XX number of companies who make the software for voting booths. I don't like the federal govt being in charge of too much (or really anything besides education standards and regulations), and similarly I don't think a one-size-fits-all model is a good idea for the software running on voting systems. It's a honeypot for hackers. Instead let's have 50 different companies each in charge of the security in each state. That way instead of hacking into one system/company, you have to hack 50. Also, different states have different kinds of elections, hold them at different times, etc. More power to the states! For instance, in Iowa they do caucuses, but in Michigan they do primaries. Sticky. Plus it allows the feds to shell out money for others to work...more jobs! Having lots of different companies which are overseen by a federal committee helps get around most of the social engineering stuff,, so how do we make the software running on the booths more secure in the first place?

Also online voting. It seems that the mainstream politicians don't want to talk about this...even though Democrats are for the people and their rights to vote. Give me a break. The only ones I heard talking about online voting and/or online registration was Jill Stein and Bernie Sanders...SITE? But unfortunately the age-old adage by politicians is that its not "secure." I invite you to read the first part of this blog...our current system is not secure. And in fact they are wrong. We all bank online, why can't we vote online? TALK ABOUT THE SECURITY OF THAT!!! There are all sorts of ways to determine if someone is who they claim to be online. SSN numbers; IP address checking to make sure the person who is voting for a candidate in State A is in State A. If not, there is then the absentee approach. Then once someone votes they're locked out...someone can then log a complaint if they cant get into the system. There are definitely kinks to work out so we should start this on a small scale in local or state elections and then build up to federal ones. Going along with what I mentioned above, f there was more voting online then the federal overnment could contract different companies in each state to design secure websites and apps...again now there are over 50 systems to hack into as opposed to just one or two.

   This involves better crypto on the machines themselves (ie. more jobs for crypto geeks), and better workers monitoring booths (more jobs). 
   Also it means better security audits on the companies that make the voting machines in the first place...more jobs!

Blockchain technology can also be used SITE...I don't want to get into this right now but suffice it to say that the same underlying tech used for Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies can also be used to ensure fair voting systems.

We've now spent billions of dollars on better voting software, educating voters, and getting more workers at the poll. Unfortunately all this does is get us back to square one: we have now ensured that only the people who voted get their votes counted and they were not changed. But this does nothing to actually fix our voting system!. Read on (the next section is neither about tech nor the Rust Belt, its just my opinions and facts about voting, so feel free to skip).

Part 4/Bonus: A better system of voting
In both the last election and the 2000 election between Buch and Gore, the Democrat candidate won the popular vote, yet the Republican won the Electoral College, granting them the presidency. Not surprisingly, this caused many voters to complain and say we should move to having a popular vote. Surprising to some, this is a very bad idea, and in fact the electoral college is vastly superior to this. Unfortunately the electoral college still isn't that great either.

  There are a few reasons why a straight popular vote is ill-advised. If we give the candidate with just the highest percentage of votes. then in a proper two-party system someone would have to get 51% of the votes to win. But we have more than two parties...in the last election there were Green and Libertarian candidates. Suppose Gary Johnson were to get more votes...you coucld end up in a situation where a candidate wins with only 34% of the country voting for them...ie. 66% of the country DID NOT vote for them.
  
  Another issue comes down to how populations are distributed. While we have a big country, the majority of the population lives in a handful of city centers: LA, NY, Houston, etc. Moving to a popular vote would effectively mean that a candidate could campaign in about 10 cities across the US, the only one in the Rust Belt being Chicago. Ouch.

  If you think this is unlikely, just suppose a candidate ran on a platform of "everyone within city 15 miles of a city center whose population is greater than 3 million people will get free wi-fi, but everyone outside of that will get a tax increase to pay for the city-dwellers wifi." We've had candidates who ran on crazier ideas than that. In fact, an idea like this would almost guarantee somebody victory...even though roughly 50% of the population would get screwed. SITE: here are some other sources which break down these points better.

So the electoral college, while flawed, at least ensures that candidates have to campaign in smaller regions and address those voters' issues to secure a victory. SITE: Hilary Clinton did not campaign once in the state of Wisconsin, lost the perennially blue state, and ultimately the election. One of the most hotly contested regions in the last 3 elections were surrounding Youngstown, Ohio...who ever talks about Youngstown unless it's a conversation about "regions outputting the best college football coaches" or "cities in the country which may be worse than Flint, MI?"

A better system to either is preferential voting. You get a list of candidates A through E, and then have to rank them from 1 to 5. Each number is assigned a point, and the candidate with the most points wins. So all those people who say "well I would prefer THIS candidate...but they're not gonna win so I guess I'll instead vote for THAT candidate" wouldn't have to do that. Not surprisingly, doing this would get more third-party candidates elected...also not surprisingly neither the Republicans nor Democrats (SITE) want this kind of system.

So do yourself a favor and call up your representative/governor/senator/council-person and say "Hey, can we start voting online cause having to deal with those old ladies at the voting booths sucks, plus it's way more secure than how we currently do things. Oh and my niece is a software engineer with a minor in policy so you should hire her to build a secure voting site for you. Also you would never have won if we did preferential voting. K thanks bye."
